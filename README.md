Bring transparency to modern development with Tab'd - a VS Code extension that tracks and visualizes AI-assisted coding, copy-paste operations, and manual edits. Help your team understand code authorship and maintain accountability in an era of AI-powered development, while gaining insights into your own coding patterns.

>**Note:** This extension is in active development. Please [raise an issue](https://github.com/iann0036/tabd/issues) if you experience any problems.

## Features

Tab'd provides intelligent tracking and visualization of different types of code changes:

- **AI-Generated Code Detection** - Automatically identifies and highlights code generated by AI assistants like GitHub Copilot and GitHub Copilot Chat
- **Visual Code Attribution** - Color-coded highlighting shows the source of each code section
- **Manual Edit Recognition** - Distinguishes between user-typed code and other edit types
- **Undo/Redo Tracking** - Tracks code changes from undo and redo operations
- **Paste Operation Tracking** - Monitors and marks code that's been pasted from external sources like StackOverflow (requires installation of the browser extension and associated Native Host)
- **Team Transparency** - Optionally share edit attribution with team members when using the "Repository" storage option, allowing others to see where AI-generated or pasted code was used
- **Persistent History** - Maintains edit history across sessions

### Visual Indicators

Tab'd uses color-coded background highlights to show different edit types:

Hovering over a highlight gives further information about the type of change, who performed the change, and when it was performed.

## Installation

1. Open the IDE
2. Go to the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X` / `Cmd+Shift+X`)
3. Search for "Tab'd"
4. Click Install

Or install from the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=iann0036.tabd).

To add web-based UI support and/or webpage clipboard support, you must also install the [browser extension](https://github.com/iann0036/tabd-extension).

## Usage

Tab'd works automatically in the background once installed. It will:

1. **Track all code changes** in supported file types
2. **Classify edit types** based on how the code was added
3. **Store tracking data** persistently for later analysis
4. **Show visual indicators** when blame view is enabled

### Commands

Access these commands via the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`):

- `Tab'd: Toggle Blame` - Show/hide the color-coded edit attribution
- `Tab'd: Toggle Enabled` - Enable/disable all Tab'd tracking

## Configuration

Tab'd uses safe, local-only defaults. You can configure Tab'd through settings:

### Settings

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `tabd.disabled` | Disable all Tab'd features | `false` |
| `tabd.storage` | Where to store tracking data | `homeDirectory` |
| `tabd.showBlame` | Show blame/attribution in the editor | `false` |
| `tabd.enableIDEClipboardMonitoring` | Track clipboard copies from the IDE (e.g. Ctrl+C, Cmd+C) | `true` |

#### Storage Options

- **Home Directory (default)** - Store data in your personal directory (private)
- **Repository** - Store data in your project's `.tabd` directory (shared with team)
- **Git Notes** - Store and push data automatically using custom-namespaced Git Notes (shared with team)

### Example Settings

```json
{
  "tabd.showBlame": true,
  "tabd.storage": "repository",
  "tabd.disabled": false,
  "tabd.enableIDEClipboardMonitoring": true
}
```

## Supported AI Extensions

The following extensions are known to be supported (though bugs will likely still exist):

- **GitHub Copilot** (inline suggestions)
- **GitHub Copilot Chat** (inline suggestions and edit/agent mode)

## Privacy & Data

Tab'd respects your privacy:

- **Safe Defaults** - No data is sent to external servers by default
- **Configurable Storage** - Choose between tracking data storage options
- **Full Control** - Quick commands to clean up your Tab'd data if needed
